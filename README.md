# Fantasy-Basketball

Developer Instructions:

Flask:
  1. Run pip install flask
  2. git clone https://github.com/neilr1/Fantasy-Basketball.git
  3. cd Fantasy-Basketball
  3. export FLASK_APP=fantasy.py
  4. export FLASK_DEBUG=1 (So we can continuously update the server without restarting it)
  5. flask run

At this point you should see your local host server with the fantasy basketball website. If not, you can type http://127.0.0.1:5000/ into your browser url to link to the website. Once that is completed and you are done viewing, you can press Control-C to disconnect from local host.
